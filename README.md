* **Data Persistence:** Uses `LocalStorage` to ensure data remains available even after refreshing the page.
* **Responsive & Modern UI:** A fully responsive "Premium Modern" dashboard built from scratch with CSS.
* **Dynamic List Management:** Add and delete transactions with immediate DOM feedback.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables, Flexbox, and Soft UI design patterns.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** DOM manipulation, Higher-order functions (`filter`, `reduce`, `map`), and LocalStorage API.
* **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD integrated with GitHub).

## 🧠 What I Learned

During the development of this project, I strengthened my skills in:
1.  **State Management:** Handling an array of objects as the "single source of truth" for the UI.
2.  **Array Methods:** Using `.reduce()` to calculate totals and `.filter()` for efficient item removal.
3.  **Modern CSS:** Mastering `border-radius`, `box-shadow` depth, and layout consistency.
4.  **Deployment Workflow:** Setting up a professional pipeline from local development to production via Vercel.
